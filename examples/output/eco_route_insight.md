## Explanation  
The current route uses fuel index = distanceKm × (payloadKg / 1000) × gradientFactor.  
For shipment-1, Current urban route gives 42.00 × 2.50 × 1.15 = 120.75.  
The policy threshold is 120.00, so a local eco banner is justified.  
The selected alternative alt-low-fuel gives 38.00 × 2.50 × 1.05 = 99.75, saving 21.00 while staying within the ETA delay limit.  
The signed envelope exposes audience, use, expiry, route suggestion, and compact fuel indices, but not raw payload, GPS trace, driver behavior, or raw telemetry.  
This follows the insight pattern: ship the decision, not the data.
