# French Cities  

## Answer  
Four cities in this small network can reach Nantes: Paris, Chartres, Le Mans, Angers.  

## Reason why  
The original example says that every :oneway link is also a :path, and that :path is transitive. So once Angers can reach Nantes directly, longer routes can be built by chaining earlier links. Angers reaches Nantes directly. Le Mans reaches Nantes through Angers. Chartres reaches Nantes through Le Mans and Angers. Paris reaches Nantes through Chartres, Le Mans, and Angers.  

## Check  
C1 OK - Angers has a direct one-way connection to Nantes  
C2 OK - Le Mans reaches Nantes by chaining Le Mans → Angers → Nantes  
C3 OK - Chartres reaches Nantes by chaining Chartres → Le Mans → Angers → Nantes  
C4 OK - Paris reaches Nantes by chaining Paris → Chartres → Le Mans → Angers → Nantes  
C5 OK - cities without a chain to Nantes are rejected by fail-loud fuse rules
